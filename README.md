This release fixes a bunch of stuff that I overlooked. Namely, just the following two problems:

Fixed selected escape menu version not applying when choosing either V1 or V2
Fixed deployment mirror selection not properly checking for errors (yknow, that "503 (Service Unavailable)" error that was probably happening to you earlier today)
I'm not gone, I'm just busy, but I do have a bunch of big things and changes planned. See you until then, unless I end up making another bugfix release.
